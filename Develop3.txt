Back to local dev. push to origin, then merge to master, then push master to origin.

Here's what you do:

1. checkout the development branch to make it active.
2. make changes as needed in the development branch (or whatever branch)
3. push these to "origin" (github) as required.

Now the local changes are synced with github, and master is behind.

4. To merge: checkout the "master" branch
5. Merge -> merge to working tree. This gets the develop branch changes into master.
6. Push master to origin
